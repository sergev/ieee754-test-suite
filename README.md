The test vectors are organized in test files, each of which correspond to a certain floating-point area or feature.

The test vectors were generated by means of [IBM Fpgen Floating-Point Test Generator](https://research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/fpgen/ieeets.shtml).

For the syntax of the test files, see [syntax.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergev/ieee754-test-suite/master/syntax.txt).

For a full understanding of the approach and the contents of the test files, refer to the [test suite document](https://github.com/sergev/ieee754-test-suite/blob/master/ieee-test-suite-v2.pdf).
